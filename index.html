    	<h2 class="hd">Dr Flame is on hiatus</h2>

    	<div class="bd">

    	<p>
	        The doctor is not in the house. Not at the moment.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	    He has turned his focus to solving the world's energy crisis - it's about time somebody took that one by the scruff of the neck and gave it a damn good go, eh?
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	As a results, he's too preoccupied to tackle your questions about farts, spacemonkeys and why your television reception is poor... for the time being anyway. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
	    If you want Dr. Flame to return, if you want it enough... I mean REALLY lots... well, it will happen. In the meantime, just go bother him via the medium of twitter....

	    Thanks for visiting the site! Have a nice day!

    		<p>
    		Dr. Flame is dead clever. He has a PhD from Cambridge University. This makes him a bona-fide, qualified egghead. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
    		He will answer your science-related questions using his giant boffin-brain.
